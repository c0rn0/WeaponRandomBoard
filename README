Random board project:
====================

Provides a frontend + backend for generating random boards from some form of input.  At the moment only a HTML-frontend is supported.

The 2nd generation of the frontend is currently in progress (being re-done in jQuery).  Forthcoming features:
 - system interaction without any HTML page redirection (desktop-app-feeling)
 - complete dynamic interaction with generated boards (via querying C++ backend with mongodb behind it)
 - more to come...

The YUI Compressor is used for both JS and CSS code minification:
java -jar yuicompressor-x.x.x.jar scripts.js -v -o scripts.min.js
java -jar yuicompressor-x.x.x.jar styles.css -v -o styles.min.css
